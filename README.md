# Subnautica-Hardcore-Save-Deleter
I hate deleting hardcore saves when speedrunning.

Run the jar, select the Subnautica or SubnauticaZero folder that you're using to speedrun, then leave it idle. The program will automatically delete any newly created saves without deleting the one you're currently using. All existing saves are left alone.

Praise be to grubbo.
