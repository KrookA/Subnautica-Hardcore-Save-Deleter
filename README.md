# Subnautica-Hardcore-Save-Deleter
I hate deleting hardcore saves when speedrunning.

Run the jar, select the Subnautica or SubnauticaZero folder that you're using to speedrun, then leave it idle. The program will automatically delete any newly created saves without deleting the one you're currently using. All existing saves are left alone.

Since the process keeps the most recent save, you should manually delete that leftover save before you start the program at the start of a new session, or at the end of a session.

Works for both Subnautica and BelowZero

Windows only.

Praise be to grubbo.
